# GPT-NeoX

This repository records [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai)'s library for training large-scale language models on GPUs. Our current framework is based on NVIDIA's [Megatron Language Model](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) and has been augmented with techniques from [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai) as well as some novel optimizations. We aim to make this repo a centralized and accessible place to gather techniques for training large-scale autoregressive language models, and accelerate research into large-scale training. This library is in widespread use in [academic, industry, and government labs](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox#adoption-and-publications), including by researchers at Oak Ridge National Lab, CarperAI, Stability AI, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Tokyo. Uniquely among similar libraries GPT-NeoX supports a wide variety of systems and hardwares, including launching via Slurm, MPI, and the IBM Job Step Manager, and has been run at scale on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [CoreWeave](https://www.coreweave.com/), [ORNL Summit](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/summit/), [ORNL Frontier](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/),  [LUMI](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/), and others.

**If you are not looking to train models with billions of parameters from scratch, this is likely the wrong library to use. For generic inference needs, we recommend you use the Hugging Face `transformers` library instead which supports GPT-NeoX models.**

## Why GPT-NeoX?

GPT-NeoX leverages many of the same features and technologies as the popular Megatron-DeepSpeed library but with substantially increased usability and novel optimizations. Major features include:
* Distributed training with ZeRO and 3D parallelism
* A wide variety of systems and hardwares, including launching via Slurm, MPI, and the IBM Job Step Manager, and has been run at scale on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [CoreWeave](https://www.coreweave.com/), [ORNL Summit](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/summit/), [ORNL Frontier](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/),  [LUMI](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/), and others.
* Cutting edge architectural innovations including rotary and alibi positional embeddings, parallel feedforward attention layers, and flash attention.
* Predefined configurations for popular architectures including Pythia, PaLM, Falcon, and LLaMA 1 & 2
* Curriculum Learning
* Easy connections with the open source ecosystem, including Hugging Face's [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) and [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/) libraries, logging via [WandB](https://wandb.ai/site), and evaluation via our [Language Model Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness).

## News
**[8/10/2023]** We now support checkpointing with AWS S3! Activate with the `s3_path` config option (for more detail, see [the PR](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/pull/1010))

**[9/20/2023]** As of https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/pull/1035, we have deprecated Flash Attention 0.x and 1.x, and migrated support to Flash Attention 2.x. We don't believe this will cause problems, but if you have a specific use-case that requires old flash support using the latest GPT-NeoX, please raise an issue.

**[8/10/2023]** We have experimental support for LLaMA 2 and Flash Attention v2 supported in our [math-lm](https://github.com/EleutherAI/math-lm) project that will be upstreamed later this month.

**[5/17/2023]** After fixing some miscellaneous bugs we now fully support bf16.

**[4/11/2023]** We have upgraded our Flash Attention implementation to now support Alibi positional embeddings.

**[3/9/2023]** We have released GPT-NeoX 2.0.0, an upgraded version built on the latest DeepSpeed which will be regularly synced with going forward.

## Versions

Prior to 3/9/2023, GPT-NeoX relied on [DeeperSpeed](https://github.com/EleutherAI/DeeperSpeed), which was based on an old version of DeepSpeed (0.3.15). In order to migrate to the latest upstream DeepSpeed version while allowing users to access the old versions of GPT-NeoX and DeeperSpeed, we have introduced two versioned releases for both libraries:

- Version 2.0 of [GPT-NeoX](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/releases/tag/v2.0) and [DeeperSpeed](https://github.com/EleutherAI/DeeperSpeed/releases/tag/v2.0) are the latest versions built on the latest DeepSpeed, and will be maintained going forward.
- Version 1.0 of [GPT-NeoX](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/releases/tag/v1.0) and [DeeperSpeed](https://github.com/EleutherAI/DeeperSpeed/releases/tag/v1.0) maintain snapshots of the old stable versions that [GPT-NeoX-20B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06745) and the [Pythia Suite](https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia) were trained on.

# Quick Start

## Environment and Dependencies

### Host Setup

First make sure you are in an environment with Python 3.8 with an appropriate version of PyTorch 1.8 or later installed. **Note:** Some of the libraries that GPT-NeoX depends on have not been updated to be compatible with Python 3.10+. Python 3.9 appears to work, but this codebase has been developed and tested for Python 3.8.

To install the remaining basic dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements/requirements-wandb.txt # optional, if logging using WandB
pip install -r requirements/requirements-tensorboard.txt # optional, if logging via tensorboard
python ./megatron/fused_kernels/setup.py install # optional, if using fused kernels
```

from the repository root.

<aside>

**Warning:** Our codebase relies on [DeeperSpeed](https://github.com/EleutherAI/DeeperSpeed), our fork of the [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) library with some added changes. We strongly recommend using Anaconda, a virtual machine, or some other form of environment isolation before continuing. Failure to do so may cause other repositories that rely on DeepSpeed to break.

</aside>

### Flash Attention

To use [Flash-Attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention), install the additional dependencies in  `./requirements/requirements-flashattention.txt` and set the attention type in your configuration accordingly (see [configs](./configs/)). This can provide significant speed-ups over regular attention on certain GPU architectures, including Ampere GPUs (such as A100s); see the repository for more details.


### Multi-Node Launching

NeoX and Deep(er)Speed support training on multiple different nodes and you have the option of using a variety of different launchers to orchestrate multi-node jobs.

In general there needs to be a "hostfile" somewhere accessible with the format:

```bash
node1_ip slots=8
node2_ip slots=8
```

where the first column contains the IP address for each node in your setup and the number of slots is the number of GPUs that node has access to. In your config you must pass in the path to the hostfile with `"hostfile": "/path/to/hostfile"`. Alternatively the path to the hostfile can be in the environment variable `DLTS_HOSTFILE`.

#### pdsh

`pdsh` is the default launcher, and if you're using `pdsh` then all you must do (besides ensuring that pdsh is installed in your environment) is set `{"launcher": "pdsh"}` in your config files.

#### MPI

If using MPI then you must specify the MPI library (DeepSpeed/GPT-NeoX currently supports `mvapich`, `openmpi`, `mpich`, and `impi`, though `openmpi` is the most commonly used and tested) as well as pass the `deepspeed_mpi` flag in your config file:

```json
{
    "launcher": "openmpi",
    "deepspeed_mpi": true
}
```

With your environment properly set up and the correct configuration files you can use `deepy.py` like a normal python script and start (for example) a training job with:

`python3 deepy.py train.py /path/to/configs/my_model.yml`

#### Slurm

Using Slurm can be slightly more involved. Like with MPI, you must add the following to your config:

```json
{
    "launcher": "slurm",
    "deepspeed_slurm": true
}
```
If you do not have ssh access to the compute nodes in your Slurm cluster you need to add `{"no_ssh_check": true}`

#### (Advanced) Custom Launching

There are many cases where the above default launching options are not sufficient

- Many clusters have their own unique job scheduler or specific MPI/Slurm arguments necessary for launching jobs such as [Summit JSRun](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/systems/summit_user_guide.html#job-launcher-jsrun) or [LLNL Flux](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/flux-building-framework-resource-management)
- While the above Slurm/MPI/pdsh default options are enough for most job runs, advanced users may want to add arguments for optimization or debugging purposes

In these cases, you will need to modify the DeepSpeed [multinode runner](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/blob/17957728c0362bf8ae70feca308e491e55ef9feb/deepspeed/launcher/multinode_runner.py) utility to support your usecase. Broadly, these enhancements fall under two categories:

##### 1. Adding a Launcher (e.g. [JSRun](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/systems/summit_user_guide.html#job-launcher-jsrun), [Flux](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/flux-building-framework-resource-management), etc)

In this case, you must add a new multinode runner class to `deepspeed/launcher/multinode_runner.py` and expose it as a configuration option in GPT-NeoX. Examples on how we did this for [Summit JSRun](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/systems/summit_user_guide.html#job-launcher-jsrun) are in [this DeeperSpeed commit](https://github.com/EleutherAI/DeeperSpeed/commit/9aed6c8500d7c492d85c5c88687322dbda70e370) and [this GPT-NeoX commit](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/commit/3782c7ae60f8624e566e3879b89bb09e8b59b869), respectively.

##### 2. Modifying Run Command or Environment Variables

We have encountered many cases where we wish to modify the MPI/Slurm run command for an optimization or to debug (e.g. to modify the [Slurm srun CPU binding](https://slurm.schedmd.com/srun.html#OPT_cpu-bind) or to tag MPI logs with the rank). In this case, you must modify the multinode runner class' run command under its `get_cmd` method (e.g. [mpirun_cmd](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/blob/17957728c0362bf8ae70feca308e491e55ef9feb/deepspeed/launcher/multinode_runner.py#L135-L147) for OpenMPI). Examples on how we did this to provide optimized and rank-tagged run commands using Slurm and OpenMPI for the Stability cluster are in [this DeeperSpeed branch](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/compare/master...EleutherAI:DeeperSpeed:v2.0-stability)


#### Hostfile Generation

In general you will not be able to have a single fixed hostfile, so you need to have a script to generate one dynamically when your job starts. An example script to dynamically generate a hostfile using [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) and 8 GPUs per node is:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
GPUS_PER_NODE=8
mkdir -p /sample/path/to/hostfiles
# need to add the current slurm jobid to hostfile name so that we don't add to previous hostfile
hostfile=/sample/path/to/hostfiles/hosts_$SLURM_JOBID
# be extra sure we aren't appending to a previous hostfile
rm $hostfile &> /dev/null
# loop over the node names
for i in `scontrol show hostnames $SLURM_NODELIST`
do
    # add a line to the hostfile
    echo $i slots=$GPUS_PER_NODE >>$hostfile
done
```

`$SLURM_JOBID` and `$SLURM_NODELIST` being environment variables Slurm will create for you. See the [sbatch documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html#SECTION_OUTPUT-ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLES) for a full list of available Slurm environment variables set at job creation time.

#### Job Launching

Then you can create an [sbatch](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html) script from which to kick off your GPT-NeoX job. A bare-bones sbatch script on a Slurm-based cluster with 8 GPUs per node would look like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name="neox"
#SBATCH --partition=your-partition
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:8

# Some potentially useful distributed environment variables
export HOSTNAMES=`scontrol show hostnames "$SLURM_JOB_NODELIST"`
export MASTER_ADDR=$(scontrol show hostnames "$SLURM_JOB_NODELIST" | head -n 1)
export MASTER_PORT=12802
export COUNT_NODE=`scontrol show hostnames "$SLURM_JOB_NODELIST" | wc -l`

# Your hostfile creation script from above
./write_hostfile.sh
# Tell DeepSpeed where to find our generated hostfile via DLTS_HOSTFILE
export DLTS_HOSTFILE=/sample/path/to/hostfiles/hosts_$SLURM_JOBID

# Launch training
python3 deepy.py train.py /sample/path/to/your/configs/my_model.yml

```

You can then kick off a training run with `sbatch my_sbatch_script.sh`


### Containerized Setup

We also provide a Dockerfile if you prefer to run NeoX in a container. To use this option, first build an image named `gpt-neox` from the repository root directory with `docker build -t gpt-neox -f Dockerfile .`. We also host pre-built images on [Docker Hub at `leogao2/gpt-neox`](https://hub.docker.com/r/leogao2/gpt-neox/tags).

You can then run a container based on this image. For instance, the below snippet mounts the cloned repository (`gpt-neox`) directory to `/gpt-neox` in the container and uses [nvidia-docker](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) to make four GPUs (numbers 0-3) accessible to the container. [As noted by the NCCL documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/troubleshooting.html#sharing-data), both `--shm-size=1g` and `--ulimit memlock=-1` are important to prevent Docker from allocating too little shared memory.
```
nvidia-docker run --rm -it -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 --shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1 --mount type=bind,src=$PWD,dst=/gpt-neox gpt-neox
```

## Usage

All functionality should be launched using `deepy.py`, a wrapper around the `deepspeed` launcher.

We currently offer three main functions:
1. `train.py` is used for training and finetuning models.
2. `evaluate.py` is used to evaluate a trained model using the [language model evaluation harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness).
3. `generate.py` is used to sample text from a trained model.

which can be launched with:

```bash
./deepy.py [script.py] [./path/to/config_1.yaml] [./path/to/config_2.yaml] ... [./path/to/config_n.yaml]
```

For example, to launch training you can run
```bash
./deepy.py train.py ./configs/20B.yaml ./configs/local_cluster.yaml
```

For more details on each entry point, see the [Training and Finetuning](#training-and-finetuning), [Inference](#inference) and [Evaluation](#evaluation) respectively.

# Configuration

GPT-NeoX parameters are defined in a YAML configuration file which is passed to the deepy.py launcher. We have provided some example .yaml files in [configs](./configs/), showing a diverse array of features and model sizes.

These files are generally complete, but non-optimal. For example, depending on your specific GPU configuration, you may need to change some settings such as `pipe-parallel-size`, `model-parallel-size` to increase or decrease the degree of parallelisation, `train_micro_batch_size_per_gpu` or `gradient-accumulation-steps` to modify batch size related settings, or the `zero_optimization` dict to modify how optimizer states are parallelised across workers.

For a more detailed guide to the features available and how to configure them, see [the configuration README](configs/README.md), and for documentation of every possible argument, see [configs/neox_arguments.md](configs/neox_arguments.md).

# Datasets

## Preconfigured Datasets

Several preconfigured datasets are available, including most components from [the Pile](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027), as well as the Pile train set itself, for straightforward tokenization using the `prepare_data.py` entry point.

E.G, to download and tokenize the enwik8 dataset with the GPT2 Tokenizer, saving them to `./data` you can run:

```
python prepare_data.py -d ./data
```

or a single shard of the pile (`pile_subset`) with the GPT-NeoX-20B tokenizer (assuming you have it saved at `./20B_checkpoints/20B_tokenizer.json`):

```
python prepare_data.py -d ./data -t HFTokenizer --vocab-file ./20B_checkpoints/20B_tokenizer.json pile_subset
```

The tokenized data will be saved out to two files: `[data-dir]/[dataset-name]/[dataset-name]_text_document.bin`and `[data-dir]/[dataset-name]/[dataset-name]_text_document.idx`. You will need to add the prefix that both these files share to your training configuration file under the `data-path` field. E.G:

```yaml
  "data-path": "./data/enwik8/enwik8_text_document",
```

## Using Custom Data

To prepare your own dataset for training with custom data, format it as one large [jsonl](https://jsonlines.org/)-formatted file with each item in the list of dictionaries being a separate document. The document text should be grouped under one JSON key, i.e `"text"`. Any auxiliary data stored in other fields will not be used.

Next make sure to download the GPT2 tokenizer vocab, and merge files from the following links:

- Vocab: https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/gpt2-vocab.json
- Merge: https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/gpt2-merges.txt

Or use the 20B tokenizer (for which only a single Vocab file is needed):

- Vocab: https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/models/GPT-NeoX-20B/slim_weights/20B_tokenizer.json

(alternatively, you can provide any tokenizer file that can be loaded by Hugging Face's tokenizers library with the `Tokenizer.from_pretrained()` command)

You can now pretokenize your data using `tools/datasets/preprocess_data.py`, the arguments for which are detailed below:

```
usage: preprocess_data.py [-h] --input INPUT [--jsonl-keys JSONL_KEYS [JSONL_KEYS ...]] [--num-docs NUM_DOCS] --tokenizer-type {HFGPT2Tokenizer,HFTokenizer,GPT2BPETokenizer,CharLevelTokenizer} [--vocab-file VOCAB_FILE] [--merge-file MERGE_FILE] [--append-eod] [--ftfy] --output-prefix OUTPUT_PREFIX
                          [--dataset-impl {lazy,cached,mmap}] [--workers WORKERS] [--log-interval LOG_INTERVAL]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

input data:
  --input INPUT         Path to input jsonl files or lmd archive(s) - if using multiple archives, put them in a comma separated list
  --jsonl-keys JSONL_KEYS [JSONL_KEYS ...]
                        space separate listed of keys to extract from jsonl. Defa
  --num-docs NUM_DOCS   Optional: Number of documents in the input data (if known) for an accurate progress bar.

tokenizer:
  --tokenizer-type {HFGPT2Tokenizer,HFTokenizer,GPT2BPETokenizer,CharLevelTokenizer}
                        What type of tokenizer to use.
  --vocab-file VOCAB_FILE
                        Path to the vocab file
  --merge-file MERGE_FILE
                        Path to the BPE merge file (if necessary).
  --append-eod          Append an <eod> token to the end of a document.
  --ftfy                Use ftfy to clean text

output data:
  --output-prefix OUTPUT_PREFIX
                        Path to binary output file without suffix
  --dataset-impl {lazy,cached,mmap}
                        Dataset implementation to use. Default: mmap

runtime:
  --workers WORKERS     Number of worker processes to launch
  --log-interval LOG_INTERVAL
                        Interval between progress updates

```

For example:

```bash
python tools/datasets/preprocess_data.py \
            --input ./data/mydataset.jsonl.zst \
            --output-prefix ./data/mydataset \
            --vocab ./data/gpt2-vocab.json \
            --merge-file gpt2-merges.txt \
            --dataset-impl mmap \
            --tokenizer-type GPT2BPETokenizer \
            --append-eod
```

You would then run training with the following settings added to your configuration file:

```yaml
  "data-path": "data/mydataset/mydataset",
```

# Training and Finetuning

Training is launched using `deepy.py`, a wrapper around DeepSpeed's launcher, which launches the same script in parallel across many GPUs / nodes.

The general usage pattern is:

```bash
python ./deepy.py train.py [path/to/config1.yaml] [path/to/config2.yaml] ...
```

You can pass in an arbitrary number of configs which will all be merged at runtime.

You can also optionally pass in a config prefix, which will assume all your configs are in the same folder and append that prefix to their path.

E.G:

```bash
python ./deepy.py train.py -d configs 125M.yaml local_setup.yaml
```

This will deploy the `train.py` script on all nodes with one process per GPU. The worker nodes and number of GPUs are specified in the `/job/hostfile` file (see [parameter documentation](configs/README.md)), or can simply be passed in as the `num_gpus` arg if running on a single node setup.

Although this is not strictly necessary, we find it useful to define the model parameters in one config file (e.g `configs/125M.yaml`) and the data path parameters in another (e.g `configs/local_setup.yaml`).


## Pretrained Models

### GPT-NeoX-20B

GPT-NeoX-20B is a 20 billion parameter autoregressive language model trained on [the Pile](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027). Technical details about GPT-NeoX-20B can be found in [the associated paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06745). The configuration file for this model is both available at [`./configs/20B.yaml`](./configs/20B.yaml) and included in the download links below.

[Slim weights](https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/models/GPT-NeoX-20B/slim_weights/) - (No optimizer states, for inference or finetuning, 39GB)

To download from the command line to a folder named `20B_checkpoints`, use the following command:

```bash
wget --cut-dirs=5 -nH -r --no-parent --reject "index.html*" https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/models/GPT-NeoX-20B/slim_weights/ -P 20B_checkpoints
```

[Full weights](https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/models/GPT-NeoX-20B/full_weights/) - (Including optimizer states, 268GB)

To download from the command line to a folder named `20B_checkpoints`, use the following command:

```bash
wget --cut-dirs=5 -nH -r --no-parent --reject "index.html*" https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/models/GPT-NeoX-20B/full_weights/ -P 20B_checkpoints
```

Weights can be alternatively be downloaded using a BitTorrent client. Torrent files can be downloaded here: [slim weights](https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/models/GPT-NeoX-20B/slim_weights.torrent), [full weights](https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/models/GPT-NeoX-20B/full_weights.torrent).

We additionally have 150 checkpoints saved throughout training, one every 1,000 steps. We are working on figuring out how to best serve these at scale, but in the meanwhile people interested in working with the partially trained checkpoints can email us at contact@eleuther.ai to arrange access.

### Pythia

The Pythia Scaling Suite is a suite of models ranging from 70M parameters to 12B parameters trained on [the Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai) intended to promote research on interpretability and training dynamics of large language models. Further details about the project and links to the models can be found in the [in the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01373) and [on the project's GitHub](https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia).

### Polyglot

The Polyglot Project is an effort to train powerful non-English pretrained language models to promote the accessibility of this technology to researchers outside the dominant powerhouses of machine learning. EleutherAI has trained and released 1.3B, 3.8B, and 5.8B parameter Korean language models, the largest of which outpreforms all other publicly available language models on Korean language tasks. Further details about the project and links to the models can be found [here](https://github.com/EleutherAI/polyglot).

# Inference

**For most uses we recommend deploying models trained using the GPT-NeoX library via the Hugging Face Transformers library which is better optimized for inference.**

We support three types of generation from a pretrained model:
1. Unconditional generation
2. Conditional generation based on an input read from a file
3. Interactive generation, which allows for multiple rounds of back-and-forth between a user and the language model via a command line interface

All three types of text generation can be launched via `python ./deepy.py generate.py -d configs 125M.yaml local_setup.yaml text_generation.yaml` with the appropriate values set in `configs/text_generation.yaml`.

# Evaluation

GPT-NeoX supports evaluation on downstream tasks through the [language model evaluation harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness).

To evaluate a trained model on the evaluation harness, simply run:

```bash
python ./deepy.py evaluate.py -d configs your_configs.yaml --eval_tasks task1 task2 ... taskn
```

where `--eval_tasks` is a list of evaluation tasks followed by spaces, e.g `--eval_tasks lambada hellaswag piqa sciq`. For details of all tasks available, refer to the [lm-evaluation-harness repo](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness).

# Exporting to Hugging Face

GPT-NeoX is optimized heavily for training only, and GPT-NeoX model checkpoints are not compatible out of the box with other deep learning libraries. To make models easily loadable and shareable with end users, and for further exporting to various other frameworks, GPT-NeoX supports checkpoint conversion to the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03771) GPTNeoXModel format.

To convert a NeoX checkpoint (with pipeline-parallel-size>=1) to Hugging Face-loadable format, run:
```bash
python ./tools/ckpts/convert_module_to_hf.py --input_dir /path/to/model/global_stepXXX --config_file your_config.yaml --output_dir hf_model/save/location
```

To convert a sequential model to Hugging Face format, run:
```bash
python  ./tools/ckpts/convert_sequential_to_hf.py --input_dir /path/to/model/global_stepXXX --config_file your_config.yaml --output_dir hf_model/save/location
```
(Note: this script should be used for v2.0 checkpoints saved on a v2.0 commit prior to https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/pull/866 and which used `pipe-parallel-size=1`. Using `pipe-parallel-size=0` will also save models in this format.)

Then to upload a model to [the Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/), run:
```bash
huggingface-cli login
python ./tools/ckpts/upload.py
```
and input the requested information, including HF hub user token.

Note, however, that this compatibility is not one-to-one, and only certain configurations from GPT-NeoX are supported in the Hugging Face GPTNeoXModel class. Advanced features such as alternative positional embeddings may require new Transformers modeling code and new conversion script tweaks.

# Monitoring

In addition to storing logs locally, we provide built-in support for two popular experiment monitoring frameworks: [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) and [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/)

<h2 id="wandb">Weights & Biases</h2>

EleutherAI is currently using [Weights & Biases to record our experiments](https://wandb.ai/eleutherai/neox). If you are logged into Weights & Biases on your machine&mdash;you can do this by executing `wandb login`&mdash;your runs will automatically be recorded. There are two optional fields associated with Weights & Biases: <code><var>wandb_group</var></code> allows you to name the run group and <code><var>wandb_team</var></code> allows you to assign your runs to an organization or team account.

## TensorBoard

We also support using TensorBoard via the <code><var>tensorboard-dir</var></code> field. Dependencies required for TensorBoard monitoring can be found in and installed from  `./requirements/requirements-tensorboard.txt`.

# Running on multi-node

If you need to supply a hostfile for use with the MPI-based DeepSpeed launcher, you can set the environment variable `DLTS_HOSTFILE` to point to the hostfile.
