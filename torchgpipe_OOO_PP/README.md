## High-efficiency AI computing SW core technology project (AIcomp)

This project is for the development of low-cost and high-efficiency AI computing platform technology to overcome the inefficiency of using excessive computing resources required for learning a large model and the dependency on a specific high-cost hypercluster when training a large learning model.

For now, we present the result of developing PoC that applies out of order technology to pipeline parallelization.

## Usage

This SW requires:
* Python3
* Pytorch 1.12+
* torchgpipe 0.0.7

## RUN

python3 source.py
