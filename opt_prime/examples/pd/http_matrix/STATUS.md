# HTTP model matrix

State: review; full goal remains active. GPU evidence remains as recorded. ATOM four-model cache-off lifecycle passes with48/48 concurrent equality; both Qwen device/host cache cases pass12/12 each. SIGPIPE fix tracked separately in #214. Remaining: RNGD routes, hybrid-state restoration, real transfer overlap and broader semantic testing.

## Production EOS correction (#229)

The common serve_batched factory now unions model generation EOS and tokenizer turn-end EOS. KONI config128001/tokenizer128009 previously continued into role delimiters; real GPU HTTP negative control ends length, fixed/stream/reuse end stop, ignore_eos remains length.22related CPU tests pass after3failed factory regressions. GPU hardware checked; NPU HTTP revalidation remains open. See serving-eos229 record/evidence229.
